# ionicMasonryExample

# An example of using Masonry and Ionic's infinite scroll to create a pinterest-style look and feel.

This uses the [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) package, and [ImagesLoaded](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded). Masonry is encapsulated by Klederman's [angular
directive](https://github.com/klederson/angular-masonry-directive).
 
We also use [faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to create some fake data. The look is similar to [The Hawaii Project](https://www.thehawaiiproject.com), my personalized book recommendation engine.

We use the infinite scroll directive built into Ionic. 

to use, you will need Ionic V1 installed. You can either use these files in their entirety, or start a new project like so:
> ionic start masonry tabs

and then merge in the changes. 

Your result should look something like [this](https://github.com/viking2917/ionicMasonryExample/blob/master/www/img/result.png).
